# WeatherStation
WeatherStation app written in Java using JavaFx. It shows the weather forecast for the next 5 days for 2 cities at the same time, 
which helps to compare the atmospheric conditions. I present all the features in the post on my personal website: https://www.bartoszchodyla.pl/portoflio/aplikacja-pogodowa-weather-station.

<h2>Installation</h2>
